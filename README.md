# CodeAlpha_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
Project Overview
This project is part of my CodeAlpha Internship (Task 1), where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to better understand its structure and uncover meaningful insights. EDA is an essential step in the data analysis process, allowing us to detect patterns, handle missing data, visualize distributions, and prepare the dataset for further modeling.

What This Project Covers
Understanding the dataset and its features

Cleaning data and handling missing values

Detecting outliers and anomalies

Performing statistical analysis

Creating data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn

Identifying key patterns, trends, and correlations

Outcome
By the end of this analysis, the dataset was thoroughly explored and cleaned, revealing several important patterns and insights that can guide decision-making and serve as a foundation for future predictive modeling.
